## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- Total Samples: 303
- Target Variable: Presence (1) or Absence (0) of Heart Disease

### Features Used (Simplified Model)
- Age
- Gender
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models Compared
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

After evaluation, **Random Forest** was selected as the final model.

## 📌 Example Prediction Output

### High Risk Example
- Age: 60
- Gender: Male
- Chest Pain Type: 3
- Blood Pressure: 160
- Cholesterol: 280

- Probability of Heart Disease: 82.45%
- Prediction: Heart Disease Present


### Low Risk Example
- Age: 30
- Gender: Female
- Chest Pain Type: 0
- Blood Pressure: 110
- Cholesterol: 150

- Probability of Heart Disease: 10.00%
- Prediction: No Heart Disease
